Once there was a way, to get back homeward
Once there was a way, to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Once there was a way, to get back homeward
Once there was a way, to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby



Boy, you're gonna carry that weight_peso
Carry that weight for a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight for a long time

I never give you my pillow_almohada
I only send you my invitation
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight for a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight for a long time

You never give me you number
You only give me your funnypapers_tiras comicas
And in the middle of interogation
I break down

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight for a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight for a long time

Oh, yeah
Alright
Are you gonna be in my dreams
Tonight

Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to
The love you make

live together in perfect harmony
side by side on my piano keyboard, oh lord, why don't we?
we all know that people are the same where ever we go
there is good and bad in ev'ryone,
we learn to live,
we learn to give each other
what we need to survive together alive.

And when I go away 
I know my heart can stay with my love 
It's understood 
It's in the hands of my love 
And my love does it good 
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa 
My love does it good 

And when the cupboard's bare 
I'll still find something there with my love 
It's understood 
It's everywhere with my love 
And my love does it good 
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa 
My love does it good 

Whoa-whoa, I love, oh-whoa, my love 
Only my love holds the other key to me 
Oh-whoa, my love, oh-oh, my love 
Only my love does it good to me 

Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa 
My love does it good 

Don't ever ask me why 
I never say goodbye to my love 
It's understood 
It's everywhere with my love 
And my love does it good 
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa 
My love does it good 

Whoa-whoa, I love, oh-whoa, my love 
Only my love does it good to me 
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa

<font color="red">NO MORE LONELY NIGHTS</font>
#################################################


I can wait another day until I call you, mm-mm, 
You've only got my heart on a string 
And ev'rything a'flutter. 

But another lonely night (and another, and another) 
Might take forever. (and another, nother) 
We've only got each other to blame, 
It's all the same to me, love. 
'Cause I know what I feel to be right. 

No more lonely nights, never be another, 
No more lonely nights. 
You're my guiding light, 
Day or night I'm always there. 

May I never miss the thrill of being near you
And if it takes a couple of years
To turn your tears to laughter
I will do what I feel to be right

And I won't go away until you tell me so, 
No, I'll never go away. 

Yes I know (I know) 
What I feel (I feel) 
To be right. (to be right) 

No more lonely nights, never be another, 
No more lonely nights. 
You're my guiding light, 
Day or night I'm always there. 

And I won't go away until you tell me so, 
No, I'll never go away. 

No more lonely nights, no, no.

You'd think that people would have had enough 
Of silly love songs 
I look around me and I see it isn't so 
Some people wanna fill the world 
With silly love songs 
And what's wrong with that? 
I'd like to know 
'cause here I go again 
I love you, I love you 
I love you, I love you 

I can't explain the feeling's plain to me; can't you see? 
Ah, she gave me more, 
She gave it all to me now can't you see? 
What's wrong with that? 
I need to know 
'cause here I go again 
I love you, I love you 

Love doesn't come in a minute 
Sometimes it doesn't come at all 
I only know that when I'm in it 
It isn't silly, love isn't silly, love isn't silly at all 

How can I tell you about my loved one? 
How can I tell you about my loved one? 

I love you (I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, 
Say can't you see?) 
I love you (Ah, he gave me all, he gave it all to me to me, 
Say can't you see) 
How can I tell you about my loved one? 
(I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, say can't you see?) 
How can I tell you about my loved one? (Ah, he gave me all, 
He gave it all to me to me say can't you see?) 
How can I tell you about my loved one? (I can't explain the 
Feeling's plain to me, say can't you see?) 
How can I tell you about my loved one? (Ah, he gave me all,

You'd think that people would have had enough 
Of silly love songs 
I look around me and I see it isn't so, oh no 
Some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs 
What's wrong with that?

<font color="red">PIPE OF PEACE</font>
#################################################

I light a candle to our love 
In love our problems disappear 
But all in all we soon discover 
That one and one is all we want to hear 
All round the world, little children being 
Born to the world, got to give them all we can 
´Til the war is won, then will the work be done 

Help them to learn song of joy instead of 
Burn baby burn, let us show them how to play 
The pipes of peace, play the pipes of peace 

Help me to learn songs of joy instead of 
Burn baby burn, won´t you show me how to play 
The pipes of peace, play the pipes of peace 

Help me to learn songs of joy instead of 
Burn baby burn, won´t you show me how to play 
The pipes of peace, play the pipes of peace 

What do you say? Will the human race 
be run in a day? Or will someone save 
This planet we´re playing on? 
Is it the only one? (What are we going to do?) 

Help them to see that the people here 
Are like you and me, let us show them how to play 
The pipes of peace, the pipes of peace 

I light a candle to our love 
In love our problems disappear 
But all in all we soon discover 
That one and one is all we want to hear

Win or lose, sink or swim
One thing is certain we’ll never give in
Side by side, hand in hand
We all stand together
Play the game, fight the fight
But what’s the point on a beautiful night? 
Arm in arm, hand in hand
We all stand together
La-
Keeping us warm in the night
La la la la
Walk in the night
You’ll get it right
Repeat
Win or lose, sink or swim
One thing is certain we’ll never give in
Side by side, hand in hand
We all stand together
