<font color="red"> Have you never been mellow</font>
#################################################################################


There was a time when I was in a hurry as you are
I was like you
There was a day when I just had to tell my point of view
I was like you
Now I don't mean to make you frown
No, I just want you to slow down

Have you never been mellow?
Have you never tried to find a comfort from inside you?
Have you never been happy just to hear your song?
Have you never let someone else be strong?

Running around as you do with your head up in the clouds
I was like you
Never had time to lay back,
Kick your shoes off, close your eyes
I was like you
Now you're not hard to understand
You need someone to take your hand

Have you never been mellow?
Have you never tried to find a comfort from inside you?
Have you never been happy just to hear your song?
Have you never let someone else be strong?

<font color="red">Let me be there</font>
#################################################################################

Wherever you go
Wherever you may wander in your life
Surely you know
I always wanna be there

Holdin' you hand
And standing by to catch you when you fall
Seein' you through
In everythin' you do

Let me be there in your mornin'
Let me be there in you night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right

Let me take you through that wonderland
That only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there

Watchin' you grow
And goin' through the changes in your life
That's how I know
I always wanna be there

Whenever you feel
you need a friend to lean on, here I am
Whenever you call
you know I'll be there

Let me be there in your mornin'
Let me be there in you night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right

Let me take you through that wonderland
That only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there

Let me be there in your mornin'
Let me be there in you night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right

Let me take you through that wonderland
That only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there
All I ask you is let me be there

<font color="red">Xanadu</font>
#################################################################################


A place where nobody dared to go
The love that we came to know
They call it Xanadu
And now, open your eyes and see
What we have made is real
We are in Xanadu

A million lights are dancing
And there you are, a shooting star
An everlasting world
And you're here with me, eternally
Xanadu, Xanadu
(Now we are here) in Xanadu
Xanadu, Xanadu
(Now we are here) in Xanadu
Xanadu, your neon lights
Will shine for you, Xanadu

The love that echoes of long ago
You needed the world to know
They are in Xanadu
The dream that came
Through a million years
That lived through all the tears
It came to Xanadu

A million lights are dancing
And there you are, a shooting star
An everlasting world
And you're here with me, eternally
Xanadu, Xanadu
(Now we are here) in Xanadu
Xanadu, Xanadu
(Now we are here) in Xanadu
