The full information for all users is stored in /etc/passwd. This file contains a record  per system user
account, and has the following format.(fields are delimited by a colon)

<font color="red">[username]:[x]:[UID]:[GID]:[Comment]:[Home directory]:[Default shell]</font>

* The username and Comment (also know as GECOS) fields are self explanatory. (autoexplicativo)
   Note: This information is often used by programs such as mail or finger and theoretically there is a 
   program called <font color="blue">chfn</font> that let you modify the infomation about the user in this field

* The x in the second field indicates that the account is protected by a shadowed password (in /etc/shadow), which
  is needed  to logon as username
* The UID and the GID are integers that represents the User Identification and the primary Group Identification to 
  which a user belongs, respectively
* The Home directory indicates the absolute path for user's home directory
* The Default Shell is the shell that will be made available to this user when he/she logins the system
  the user can change the default shell by means of the <font color="blue">chsh</font> program. the eligible shells are listed in /etc/shells
  or by executing <font color="blue">chsh --list</font> command
