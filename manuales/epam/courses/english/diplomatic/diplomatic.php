<font color="blue">LESSON 3. MAKING MEANING CLEAR</font>
Hello!
Welcome to lesson 3 of the course Diplomatic English. 
This lesson is about the strategies you need for effective communication. 
We spend a fair amount of our time exchanging information with colleagues and customers - sharing daily updates, 
collecting customer requirements or discussing product delivery. However, effective communication is more than 
just the exchange of information from sender to receiver. Productive and meaningful communication is a complex,    
two-way process which includes both    the ability to speak and the ability to listen.

In this lesson we are going to practice the L.I.S.T.E.N. model that involves six strategies you need to follow to 
make your meaning clear and avoid misunderstanding. Each letter illustrates a certain strategy. 

<font color=red>‘L’ stands for strategy number one: ‘Look and sound interested’</font>
When talking to someone, make sure you ‘Look and sound interested’. In a face-to-face meeting you can achieve that 
by making eye contact. If it’s an online meeting and your camera is off, make sure you make short polite comments 
that indicate interest, for example    Right, I see, I understand, Yes, Of course, Really?, Oh that's interesting, Uh huh.

<font color=red>'I' stands for Inquire,</font> which basically means asking for more information. To ask for more details about particular ideas, you can say:    
What exactly do you mean by [word]? 
Could you clarify what you mean by.. ? 
Could you say a little more about?  
Could you run through that again, please? 

<font color=red>The next letter is 'S', which represents Summarize.</font> Summarizing is an important communication strategy. If you realize
that other people don’t understand you, you should be able to explain your ideas in a different way. To make your own 
meaning clear, use such expressions as    :
I mean; 
What I mean is; 
What I am trying to say is;
What I’m saying is…; 
In other words; 
Ok, let me put it another way.

<font color=red>T’ stands for  ‘Test if you understand’</font>. In other words, it’s checking understanding.  A common way to check your understanding 
is to paraphrase what the other person has said using your own words. You can say,  
So, what you are saying is ….
So, just to be clear, …  right?
Sorry, are you saying that….?
So, what you mean is ….

<font color=red>‘E’ represents     ‘Encourage’.</font> Another important strategy that ensures effective communication is encouraging questions and engaging 
the listener. We can achieve that by asking  
Do you have any questions?
Is everything clear so far?
Do you see what I mean?
Did that make sense?

Last but not least, we arrive at <font color=red>'N', which stands for 'Neutralize'.</font> Sometimes we need to say that something is not clear to us. 
But we should do it politely without blaming others for the misunderstanding. Avoid saying   ‘I think you are wrong’, instead say    
‘Maybe I've got it wrong...’ Other alternatives for neutralizing this kind of messages are
Perhaps I've misunderstood...
I'm afraid I don’t follow...
Sorry, I don’t quite see what you mean. …

In this lesson we’ve presented   the L.I.S.T.E.N. model consisting of 6 strategies. When   speaking, you will most likely need to use 
strategies such as    Summarize and Encourage. While   listening, make sure you    Inquire and Test if you understand.  Two strategies 
of the L.I.S.T.E.N. model, however,  can be used both    when speaking and listening.  They are   Look and sound interested and Neutralize. 
I hope you’ve found this information useful. Now let’s see how the strategies work in real life situations. Please go to the practice section,
 listen to 4 short conversations and identify the strategies in each.
Good luck with your studies!
