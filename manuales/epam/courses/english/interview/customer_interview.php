<FONT COLOR="BLUE">WHAT IS A CUSTOMER INTERVIEW</FONT>

- To learn some handy tips for successful participation in a customer interview
- To learn some handy interview phrases for managing a conversation
- To practice asking questions to the interviewer


- Welcome to the Preparation for Customer Interview Course
which is intended for EPAMers getting ready for an
interview with a customer. In this lesson we are going to
look at what the customer interview is and discuss some
handy tips to help you ace the interview (ganar la entrevista) and impress the
interviewer with your communication and presentation skills.

<font color="red">What is a customer interview?</font>

We have asked three EPAMers to define the notion for us.

- Well, it’s a dialogue between a candidate and a customer to see how
confident the candidate is and how effectively he or she
can solve problems. For the most part, I guess the interview
is conducted by a technical expert and the main goal
in this case is to check the candidate’s technical skills
and assess his or her communication skills.
In other words, to see how good the candidate is at telling stories
of their achievements and professional challenges.

- A customer interview is a procedure conducted by a client to identify
if a candidate meets the position requirements. Usually it consists of two parts.
The first is general. When the customer tries to find out what sort of
person you are, and gauge your communication and soft skills. (y evalúa tus habilidades comunicativas y sociales)
Here you may be asked about your working experience,
the projects you have done, as well as your plans for the future.
The second part is technical. Here the customer
tries to figure out whether your technical skills and knowledge match the
job requirements. On average the interview lasts from 30 to 60 minutes.

- Well, I think a customer interview is asking special questions about
the business of the client and your responsibilities on the future project.
It’s a chance to discuss all the relevant details about the project.

- Now, you’ve got the idea of what the customer interview is.
In a nutshell,( en pocas palabras)  it’s an opportunity for the customer to get in-depth
information about your soft, technical and communication skills,
your experience and ability to problem-solve.
It’s an opportunity for you to get information
about the new project and your role in it.



<FONT COLOR="BLUE">HANDY TIPS</FONT>



- Hello. In this video we are going to discuss some handy
tips to help you ace the interview and impress the
interviewer with your communication and presentation skills.
Participation in a customer interview is
always frightening and stressful no matter how many
interviews you’ve gone through in your career.
However, there are a lot of useful tips and recommendations
that can help you make the experience less painful
and more successful. The key to success is thorough
preparation, of course. Let’s ask our expert for some
useful guidelines that the candidates getting ready
for an interview should follow.
Glen, what are your top tips?
- Well, there are a lot of recommendations
on how to prepare for and succeed in an interview.
I would divide them into two groups: things you should
do before the interview and things you should do
during the interview. Let’s start with the ones that
must be done beforehand. First of all, get as much
information about the customer and the project as possible.
Before the interview, you need to have a clear
understanding of the position requirements so that
you can be ready to discuss how your knowledge and
skills can meet the customer’s requirements.
You can gather this information from your Project Manager or
Resource Manager and the position description provided
by the customer before the interview.
Secondly, you need to take some time to review the most common
interview questions. Knowing what you're going to say
can reduce a lot of interview stress. Think about the
things you want to say in the interview that demonstrate
your expertise; then ask yourself how you will speak
about them. It might be even worth writing down
your answers to such typical questions as Tell me about
yourself, or What is your major achievement?
But don’t memorize them by heart because you will sound
too rehearsed and not natural. (demasiado ensayado y no natural)
Ok, now let’s talk about what you should do during the interview.
Well, first of all, be prepared for small talk.
It’s quite common for the interviewer to start the call with
some light, casual conversation to create a friendly
atmosphere and put the candidate at ease.
So, don’t be surprised if the customer starts the interview
with How are you doing today? or What’s the weather
like in Minsk? Make sure you know how to answer these
questions and keep the conversation going. It's important
that from the minute you say hello, you make a
positive, lasting impression with a client.
Secondly, interviewers really appreciate when you listen to the
question and answer it thoughtfully and concisely.( responderla de manera concisa y concisa.)
Avoid giving just Yes or No answers. It is really
frustrating for the interviewer not to get answers to
their questions. They may think you have nothing to say
or simply do not understand English well enough.
When you are asked about your technical skills, describe
how you applied your technical skills to solve a
business problem. Do not simply mention the skills you
have without giving examples of how they helped you.
Demonstrate your talents and skills by providing
specific examples. This information may help the
interviewer understand whether you will be able to provide
the solutions they are looking for.
Also, it is important to emphasize your role in the previous projects.
The customer wants to hear about your contribution,
not what the system was about or what process the
team followed. For example, you may say I was responsible
for adding new Oracle8i functionality to the
existing applications. When you answer the interviewer’s
questions, remember that every word counts.
Always use verbs that create a strong, long-lasting impression.
For example, instead of saying, I came up with a
system that saved us a lot of time on data entry, say,
I created and implemented a time-saving, data-entry system.
Can you feel the difference?
One more important point to remember. When answering the interviewer’s
question, do not to give out any confidential information
about past companies, customers and projects.
Remember that you signed a confidentiality agreement with them.
If you don't know the answer to a
question, it's better to be honest about it.
Don’t make it up. Explain that you never worked with this
technology or tool before, but show your eagerness at (pero muestra tu entusiasmo en"
the same time to learn. If you do have any knowledge
of the question, then take the time to tell your
interviewer what you know. You may start with Oh, that’s
interesting, let me think…
Even if you don't know the answer, you can tell the interviewer the steps you
would take to address the problem. This will demonstrate
your ability to adapt to the situation and think
on the spot. The interviewer wants to see that you can
take initiative and have the resources to come up
with a solution of your own.
What else? Don’t be shy to ask for clarification. If you’re not sure you’ve
understood the question correctly, ask them to repeat
the question. It’s not a big deal for the interviewer.
Moreover, nobody expects you to have a native-like
English level. So, if you don’t get the question
the first time around, just simply say Could you please
repeat the question? Do not answer the question if
you doubt whether you’ve understood it correctly.
Check the meaning by asking Sorry, do you mean..?,
Do you want me to…?
One more thing. Make sure you ask the interviewer some questions about the position and
the future project. The interview should be a two-way
exchange of information. What’s more, the questions
you ask confirm your qualifications as a candidate for
the position. So, don’t be shy about asking questions
during the interview.
- Glen, you’re a real pro! I bet you have some more tips up your sleeve!
Glen?
Earth to Glen!
- The thing that you’ve probably noticed, is
that I was silent and didn’t provide any verbal
reaction to your question. So, you must have thought
that there was something wrong with me. Perhaps
I didn’t hear you well or simply didn’t understand the question.
Awkward silence during the interview is
called dead air and should be avoided. If you don’t
know the answer off the top of your head, just tell
the interviewer that you need some time to think.
You can say Let me think about this for a second or
How shall I put it? Also, when the interviewer is talking
about something for more than a minute, it’s a
good idea to show that you are following along.
This technique is called active listening. The most common
active listening phrases are Right, I see, Exactly,
Uhuh. I guess that’s about it.
- Thank you, Glen, for your expert advice! Alright, let’s check how well you
remember all the recommendations we have mentioned.
To put your knowledge to the test, please take the
true-false quiz in this lesson. And see you soon!

<FONT COLOR="BLUE">Useful Information: Asking Questions</font>
If you want to impress the interviewer during the interview, ask a few relevant questions about the position and the project. By asking well-prepared questions during the job interview you demonstrate your interest, initiative and strategic understanding of the position and the company.

So, it’s a good idea to prepare a few questions for yourself before the interview. Please study the tips below for asking job interview questions:

Always prepare questions to ask. Having no questions sends the message that you haven’t given the interview enough thought or that you are not experienced enough.
Some of your questions may be answered during the interview, before you are offered the opportunity to ask them. In that case, you could ask for additional clarification, e.g. Sorry, do you mean…?, Do you want me to…?, Are you saying that…?
Only ask the questions that are relevant to the job, department, management and organization.
Do not ask questions that are clearly answered on the customer's website and/or in any literature provided by the customer to you in advance. This would simply reveal that you did not prepare for the interview, and that you are wasting the customer's time by asking these questions.
Avoid interrupting the interviewer. Make sure you ask your questions or make your comments at appropriate times during the interview.
Ask open-ended questions. Closed questions that require just a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response contribute little to the interview and provide you with minimal information.
Avoid any Why-questions because you are likely to receive quite predictable because-answers to such questions. Instead, use such structures as What are the benefits of, what are the advantages of, what is the reason for, and so on.
e.g. What are the benefits/advantages of using this framework?; What was the reason for choosing this framework?
