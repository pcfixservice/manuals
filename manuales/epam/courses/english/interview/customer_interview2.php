In this video, we're going to walk you through answering the question ‘Tell me about yourself’.
For starters, we’ll show you a sample answer with a commentary, and then an improved version.
So with the help of this video you should be able to learn how to create a well-structured, compelling self-presentation.
Also, we’ll present some useful phrases to you that you can use when crafting your story about yourself.
We asked Andrei, a front-end engineer, who’s preparing for a customer interview, to answer the question ‘What can you tell us about yourself?’ Let’s listen.

<FONT COLOR="BLUE">Bad example</font>
Hello. My name’s Andrei.
I have more than 8 years of engineering experience.
I graduated from Belarusian State University, faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics in 2008.
I thought the time had come to find a serious job when I was doing my final year at university, 
so I applied for the position of a junior front-end engineer at EPAM.
Well, I successfully passed the interview and got the job of a Junior Specialist.
And since then I’ve had a lot of different projects.
My knowledge about technologies is a great list – HTML , CSS, JS, AJAX, Angular JS, JSON, and jQuery library.
I know all the ins and outs of Bootstrap framework .
And I’ve familiarized myself with TypeScript and Swift 2.
In general, I guess I have a solid foundation in the front-end area.
Also, I have an excellent level of English speaking and writing skills.
I'm a lead software engineer with broad knowledge in team management.
I have great experience in presentations, dealing with conflicts, decision-making, problem-solving, and teleconferencing.
Also, I am a good team-player and can work well under pressure.
I’m reliable, communicative, resourceful, creative, flexible, and proactive.
Moreover, I am interested in learning new things, and now I'm going to get to grips with a new language for me - Python.

Well, Andrei has made quite a good start by introducing himself with My name is… 
and stating the approximate number of years he’s spent in the industry.
However, at the very beginning he forgot to mention an extremely important piece of information - his general role and professional focus.
This information is crucial for the interviewer and should not be skipped.
To describe your role, you can use such structures as I work as…. ; I do..; Currently I am responsible for..; 
My role is to…; Specifically, I focus on…; I’m involved in …
Please note that after some structures you need to use a noun or an ING form.
For example, Currently I’m responsible for data centers or Currently I’m responsible for building data centers.
While after others, you should use an infinitive.
For instance, my role is to build the tools for…
After you have stated your general role and responsibilities, you might want to mention a few major highlights in your career.
Start with the first most relevant job you had and finish up with the most recent one.
Do not expand much on the roles that are not relevant to the current position.
Also, it’s not a good idea to dedicate too much time to the description of your educational background in a short self-presentation.
Particularly, if you graduated a long time ago.
That was Andrei’s mistake.
When talking about his career path, he should’ve briefly summarized two or three project roles he had since the start of his career.
The following phrases can help you structure your career path description: I started on the [engineering] side for a bit, 
then went over to [test automation], When I first joined EPAM, I did … Prior to EPAM I worked at/with…, Finally, I transitioned to the [project/role]…
it’s also the right time to draw the interviewer’s attention to the professional expertise you’ve developed by saying:
Working on my previous project I’ve acquired considerable experience in..
I’ve also gained a broad understanding of… ;
Over the past two years, I’ve become familiar with..
Make sure that you use correct tense forms when speaking about your career path and experience.
We use Past Simple when we mention at what time in the past something happened.
For example, I joined EPAM in 2009.
Besides, Past Simple is used when we list many events that happened one after another.
‘I started as a front-end engineer, went over to back-end side, and then moved back to front-end over a year ago’.
To speak about the whole period that hasn’t finished yet we use Present Perfect.
‘I have had a number of roles here at EPAM; I’ve been with EPAM for close to 8 years.’
Andrei was quite good in terms of listing technologies and frameworks in his self-presentation.
But you should not go through the whole list of tools and technologies you are familiar with during a two-minute self-introduction.
Remember that your resume is in front of the interviewer, so there’s no need to recite it.
Just mention a few most relevant technologies.
For example, the technologies you can easily comment on if the interviewer asks you additional questions.
Andrei is a slightly overconfident candidate.
He is claiming to be an expert in English and team management.
That sounds a bit boastful.
Another mistake is that Andrei mentions too many skills and qualities which he fails to support with examples.
Instead of presenting a long list of skills and qualities, select 3 or 4 and relate them to some tasks you’ve carried out on previous projects.
Here’re a few useful structures to talk about skills:
Among my soft skills I can name … I’m pretty good at … I’m quite comfortable with … because…
So, I guess we’ve highlighted the most important things that will help you prepare a good self-presentation.
Now let’s listen to Andrei again having another go at introducing himself.
I’m sure he’ll shine at it this time.

<FONT COLOR="BLUE">Good example</font>
Hello. My name is René.

Currently, I am working as a Linux Engineer at Epam Systems, dealing with Google customer issues, and all related to the Google Cloud platform, 
I have to say that Constant communication with Google customers have helped me to develop good communication skills

In general, I’ve been in the IT industry for 10  years. I think over all that time I’ve gained a broad understanding of the complex technologies that deal with the Linux OS.

Working on my previous project I’ve also acquired considerable experience in the Linux administration role, 
I have experience working with several distros such as Red Hat, Suse linux, Debian and Ubuntu, and well, 
this envolves knowing network administration, virtualization administration and finally system administration

Also, I have to mention that I have two  certifications issued by the Linux Professional institute which are the Linux system administration and Linux Engineer

I hope it won’t sound boastful if I say I can work well under pressure, I consider myself to be reliable, resourceful and quite adaptable.

To my mind, all these things are a must-have when you work in a distributed team spanning different time zones,
