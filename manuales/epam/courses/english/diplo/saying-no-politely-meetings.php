<font color="red">Hello! In this video we will look closely at how to say NO in a business meeting. </font>
We will examine the strategies for saying NO and the phrases used for this purpose. So let’s proceed.
First, listen to a conversation between a senior software engineer and his Resource Manager.
As you listen, try identify the strategies the Resource Manager uses to avoid simply saying NO. If possible, take some notes.

So let’s now analyze what key strategies we can identify in the conversation and what language was used as an alternative to NO.
First, the manager checked understanding: <font color="blue">Let me see if I’ve understood you correctly. You mean …</font>
Then the manager expressed doubt and asked for more details: <font color="blue">I’m not so sure about this. Could you give me some more details on…</font>
Next, she showed support before politely rejecting her colleague’s suggestion.
<font color="blue">I hear what you are saying, but</font>
When saying NO, the manager has also explained WHY they were unable to fulfil the request <font color="blue">I’m afraid we are not able to… at this stage because …</font>
Finally, to smooth things over, she offers an alternative: <font color="blue">Why don’t we…</font>
So, the framework for saying ‘NO’ politely is the following:
<font color="green">1. Checking understanding
2. Expressing doubt and asking for details
3. Showing support
4. Saying NO and explaining why
5. Offering an alternative</font>
Thanks for watching. I hope you’ve found this information useful. 
Now, it's time to practice the language you can use for each strategy. 
Please go to the practice section and do the suggested activities there. Good luck with your studies.
